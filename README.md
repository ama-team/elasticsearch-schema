# WIP Draft

This project hasn't reached 0.1.0 release yet, there is nothing to use.

# ElasticSearch schema

This project maintains a declarative schema of various ElasticSearch
options - types, type parameters, tokenizers, filters, etc. Such a 
schema allows to produce other projects (libraries, tools, etc.) that
would be able to validate configurations, generate annotations, and do
other routine things automatically.
