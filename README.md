# WIP Draft

This project hasn't reached 0.1.0 release yet and doesn't provide all 
planned functionality. use at your own desire to try new stuff.

# ElasticSearch schema

This project maintains a declarative schema of various ElasticSearch
options - types, type parameters, tokenizers, filters, etc. Such a 
schema allows to produce other projects (libraries, tools, etc.) that
would be able to validate configurations, generate annotations, and do
other meta-things automatically.

The goal of this project is to provide an API for various languages to 
get such schema for specific ElasticSearch version and ES plugins.
